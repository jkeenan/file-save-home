Changes for Perl extension File::Save::Home

0.04 Sun Nov 13 08:46:00 EST 2005

Reworked restore_subhome_directory_status to use code from Perl Cookbook
recipe 9.8, rmtree1, to remove directory and its contents.  In test files,
either eliminated chdir-ing to home directory entirely, or limited its scope
to minimum necessary.

Forgot to include File::Temp under PREREQ_PM in Makefile.PL.


0.02 Sat Nov 12 21:15:00 2005

Reformulated in response to feedback on 0.01 from Michael Graham.  First
general release version.  lib/File/Save/Home.pm exports seven functions on
request:

    get_home_directory
    get_subhome_directory_status
    make_subhome_directory
    restore_subhome_directory_status 
    conceal_target_file 
    reveal_target_file 
    make_subhome_temp_directory 

There are 4 files in the test suite:

    01_test.t
    02_multilevel.t
    03_placefile.t
    04_tempdir.t

Underneath the t/ directory there is found package String::MkVarName, which
exports one function:

    make_varname

CPAN upload.
