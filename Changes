Changes for Perl extension File::Save::Home

0.02 Sat Nov 12 21:15:00 2005

Reformulated in response to feedback on 0.01 from Michael Graham.  First
general release version.  lib/File/Save/Home.pm exports seven functions on
request:

    get_home_directory
    get_subhome_directory_status
    make_subhome_directory
    restore_subhome_directory_status 
    conceal_target_file 
    reveal_target_file 
    make_subhome_temp_directory 

There are 4 files in the test suite:

    01_test.t
    02_multilevel.t
    03_placefile.t
    04_tempdir.t

Underneath the t/ directory there is found package String::MkVarName, which
exports one function:

    make_varname

CPAN upload.
