Changes for Perl extension File::Save::Home

0.02 Wed Nov  9 20:43:18 2005

Began to reformulate in response to feedback on 0.01 from Michael Graham.

0.01 Mon Oct 31 09:55:38 2005
Original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.43.  Adapted from
functions in ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Auxiliary and
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Utility.  After I made a presentation to the Toronto
Perlmongers on October 27, 2005, Michael Graham suggested that these functions
could be extracted to a separate Perl extention for more general
applicability.
