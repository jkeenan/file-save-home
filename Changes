Changes for Perl extension File::Save::Home

0.09 Fri Dec 14 19:34:00 EXT 2012

Two spelling corrections reported by Xavier Guimard.

0.08 Wed Feb 22 22:14:24 EST 2006

Modified get_subhome_directory_status() and make_subhome_temp_directory() so
that each takes an optional additional argument which is name of a valid
directory which user wishes to use as a ''pseudo-home-directory'' in place of
the output of get_home_directory().  Wrote t/05_pseudohome.t to test this
revised functionality.  Wrote t/06_Win32.t to make sure that this
functionality works with File::HomeDir::my_home() on Windows.

0.07 Fri Feb 17 19:42:05 EST 2006

No change in functionality.  At suggestion of Rob Rothenberg, expanded
documentation, particularly in ''SEE ALSO'' section, to reference other CPAN
distributions which try to locate a user's home directory.

0.06 Fri Nov 25 10:35:00 EST 2005

No change in functionality.  New version prepared solely to accommodate change
in name of String::MkVarName to String::PerlIdentifier.

0.05 Sat Nov 19 12:42:46 EST 2005

File::Save::Home's test suite now uses String::MkVarName v0.03 or later from
CPAN, rather than a copy of that module stored under the t/ directory.
Appropriate changes to Makefile.PL and t/*.t files made.

0.04 Sun Nov 13 08:46:00 EST 2005

Reworked restore_subhome_directory_status to use code from Perl Cookbook
recipe 9.8, rmtree1, to remove directory and its contents.  In test files,
either eliminated chdir-ing to home directory entirely, or limited its scope
to minimum necessary.

0.03 Sat Nov 12 21:38:00 2005

Forgot to include File::Temp under PREREQ_PM in Makefile.PL.


0.02 Sat Nov 12 21:15:00 2005

Reformulated in response to feedback on 0.01 from Michael Graham.  First
general release version.  lib/File/Save/Home.pm exports seven functions on
request:

    get_home_directory
    get_subhome_directory_status
    make_subhome_directory
    restore_subhome_directory_status 
    conceal_target_file 
    reveal_target_file 
    make_subhome_temp_directory 

There are 4 files in the test suite:

    01_test.t
    02_multilevel.t
    03_placefile.t
    04_tempdir.t

Underneath the t/ directory there is found package String::MkVarName, which
exports one function:

    make_varname

CPAN upload.


0.01 Mon Oct 31 09:55:38 2005

Original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.43.
